Study App Development
Research background and purpose
Today, information equipment such as smartphones or tablets are widespread. Managing study plans and monitoring progress on personal devices allows users to plan effectively and track their study results in a visual manner.

Development environment
We are developing this application with Android Studio 2024.1.1 and Kotlin. Test devices are Galaxy S22 and Pixel XL (visual terminal). We manage app versions on Git/GitHub.

Demand local applications 
A local application has better performance and stronger security than Web applications.
We develop study application with these features. It’s expected that It be satisfying for users.

Improvement 
We will improve the application continually with User feedback and data analysis.
We will get feedback by conducting user surveys on a regular basis.
It will teach us about users complaints and needs, and we think improvement plans based on them.

Database
We use SQLite database. “study_app.db” has tables (tasks, events, study time, sleep data). They were designed for app Activity to operate CRUD easily.

App Components
Main Activity has a role to control the whole of this app. That enables each fragment to access quickly.
There are 4 fragments, home, schedule and to do list. Home shows the result of analyzing users study circumstance. Schedule, users manage their schedules. Study Time receive study time data and save. To Do List, users manage their tasks.

Utilize Sleep API
We can analyze user’s sleep data by calling Sleep API. There are 3 steps. 1st, Permission request. We need agreement of users to use Sleep API. 
2nd, API registration and display UI. Applications register API when it receives permission and design UI based on sleep data. 
3rd, Unsubscribe.
